In [[Databases]], SQL is a language for interacting with [[Relational Model]] and giving us a declarative way of performing [[Relational Algebra]]. 

Main features:
- Data independent: decoupled from physical view
- Views: precomputed queries that increase decoupling
- Wrapper perspective: basically like a wrapper around relational algebra.
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): recall, this is all about queries
- DDL: Data Definition Language: recall, this is all about table management. Specify schema, value types, integrity constraints, indices, security & authorization, physical storage structure.
